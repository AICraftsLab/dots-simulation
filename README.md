Dots Evolution Simulation Program

Uses Simple Genetic Algorithm to evolve dots to move to a target position. The chromosome is a list of direction vectors that define the path taken (or to be taken) by a genome (dot).

Looking forward to add BRAIN to the dots using NEAT and discard the chromosome thing.
