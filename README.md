# Dots Evolution Simulation Program
[Project is ongoing, check [blog](https://dev.to/abdulrazaqas/dots-simulation-using-genetic-algorithm-part-1-1obh)]

Uses Simple Genetic Algorithm to evolve dots to move to a target position marked red. The chromosome is a list of direction vectors that define the path taken (or to be taken) by a genome (dot).

Feel free to tune these hyperparametes because they drive the evolution process:
1. `MUTATION_PROB`
2. `MATING_POOL_SIZE`
3. `ELITISM`
4. `DOTS_XVEL`

Looking forward to add **BRAIN** to the dots using NEAT and discard the chromosome thing.
